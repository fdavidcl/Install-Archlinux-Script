Arch Linux Installer Script
===========================

A simple script to install Arch Linux easy and fast. Forked from [analca3's script](https://github.com/analca3/Install-Archlinux-Script).

It's simple but strongly opinionated: 

- mirrors from osl.ugr.es
- UEFI-only
- Btrfs root partition (no support for more partitions yet, may be added later)
- Fish shell
- GNOME DE with extensions
- Code-OSS with some extensions
- Lots of packages for development

It includes some useful tweaks for laptops and Thinkpad X1 models in particular.
